Working with a partner we will practice collaborating with with others. On GitHub I have a created a [repo](https://github.com/bcknr/IntroToGit_Activity) for this activity.

## Fork the `IntroToGit_Activity` repo

Working on one computer navigate to the [repo created for this activity](https://github.com/bcknr/IntroToGit_Activity) and fork the repo. The person who's computer you are working on will be "partner 1" for the remainder of this activity.

## Add a collaborator

Add your partner as a collaborator to the forked repo using their GitHub username.

## Clone the Repo

Now each working on your own, follow the steps to clone the repo to your machine.

## Explore the Code

In the new project open the file named `script.R`. Get in the habit of making sure you're working on the most up to date version by pulling any changes before you dive into the code.

You'll note that the code is to create a horribly colored plot of `Sepal.Length` vs `Sepal.Width` data from `iris` dataset. It may also look familiar from our discussion of merge conflicts (foreshadowing).

```{r}
# Load Iris dataset and ggplot2
library(datasets)
library(ggplot2)
data("iris")

# Plot
plot <- ggplot(iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width, color = Species)) +
  geom_point(size = 2) +
  geom_smooth() +
  xlab("Sepal Length") +
  ylab("Sepal Width") +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("tan", "wheat", "burlywood2")) +
  theme_bw()
  
plot
```

## Modify the code

### Without a conflict...

Each partner should then edit a unique part of the code.

Partner 1 - Add your name or a comment to line 6 (`# Partner 1:`)

Partner 2 - Add your name or a comment to line 8 (`# Partner 2:`)

Now that both of you have edited your file, partner 1 should stage, commit, and push their changes to github.

Have partner two pull the new changes. What happens?

Resolve the error message (see the [step-by-step](../intro/collab.qmd) if you can't figure out how) and try pushing your changes again. Was it successful? What does the message mean?

### With a conflict...

Now that we have successfully experienced the joys of an automatic merge we will force a conflict. **Without** consulting with your partner each of you should choose a new color palette for this figure by changing the names in `scale_color_manual()` and save the changes.

Have one partner stage, commit, and push their changes first. Once they are done have the other partner try pulling the changes. Was it successful?

Following the error message we should first try committing the change and then pull again. This will create a merge conflict.

Work with your partner to resolve the conflict, commit the resolution, and push the resolved changes.
