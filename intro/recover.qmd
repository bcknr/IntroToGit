## Reset your Repo

Git allows you to recover from mistakes by allowing you to revert to previous versions.

If you commit your changes and push them to GitHub often you can

1.  Save a copy of your project directory somewhere else safe just in case, and

2.  Rename your local repository

3.  Clone the repo to your machine again

4.  Copy any necessary files to the new directory and check that everything works

5.  Stage, commit, push

We will practice this in the ["Break it"](../activities/recover_act.qmd) activity.

## Undo your last commit

If you need to revert to before your last commit your can use the command line.

As you learn git `git reset -- soft HEAD^` may come in handy as it will take you back to where you were right before you hit commit.

## Revert to the last commit in the RStudio GUI

If you prefer using RStudio's visual git commands you can revert to the last committed version of a file by clicking on the "diff" button (![](/images/diffButton.png){width="62" height="25"}) and selecting the file you would like to revert. In the bottom you will see all of the changes you made (deletions in red, additions in green).

To revert all of the changes, select the file you want to revert and click "revert" at the top of the window.
