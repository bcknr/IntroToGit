## Add a Collaborator

You can add collaborators to a private (or public) repo in GitHub by clicking `settings` \> `Collaborators` \> `Add People`

If you are doing a lot of collaboration it will benefit you to learn about [branches](https://happygitwithr.com/git-branches.html#git-branches). These allow you to work collaboratively without always stepping on each others toes or work on part of a project without worrying too much about breaking the whole thing. Once you are satisfied with how the branch is performing you can merge your branch with the main branch.

## Merge (and merge conflicts)

## Forks

GitHub allows you to get a copy of other public repositories. You can either clone the repo using the same method as you would for cloning your own or you can "fork and clone".

Forking has the added benefit of allowing you to suggest changes to the repository owner (called "pull requests").

To fork a repo...

1.  Click on "Fork" in the top right when on the repo's main page
