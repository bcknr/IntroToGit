If you have used GitHub in the past, but not for a while, you may not be familiar with the use of Personal Access Tokens (PATs). PATs allow you to securely link your local Git repo with GitHub with HTTPS.

## Generating a PAT

You can create a new PAT with the `usethis` package in R (recommended) or on GitHub itself.

:::{.panel-tabset}

### R

In R type:

```{r}
#| eval: false
usethis::create_github_token()
```

This will open GitHub in a browser window, just like if you chose to create a PAT through GitHub alone (see other tab), but some of the work was done for you.

In the "Note" field describe what your token will be used for. This is not super important for now, but in the future if you use multiple PATs you will want to know what they do. I usually name it after where I will use the token or a certain project (e.g., `linux_vm_R`). By default PATs expire. You can change the expiration date or select "no expiration".

Once you are satisfied scroll to the bottom of the page and click the green "Generate Token" button. Your token will be displayed on the next page. **Once you navigate away from this page you will not be able to see you PAT again.** Copy the token and store it somewhere safe. I store mine as an entry in password manager.

### GitHub

Click on your profile picture in the upper right hand corner of GitHub and select `settings`

Scroll down through your settings (this is also where you can set up your profile further) and select the last option in the menu on the left, `Developer settings` .

Select `Personal access tokens` -\> `Tokens (classic)` -\> `Generate new token` -\> `Generate new token (classic)`

![](/images/pat3.png){fig-align="center"}

You can now describe what your token will be used for. This is not super important for now, but in the future if you use multiple PATs you will want to know what they do. I usually name it after where I will use the token or a certain project (e.g., `linux_vm_R`). By default PATs expire. You can change the expiration date or select "no expiration". Under "Select scopes" check the boxes next to repo, workflow, gist, and user. I have not found the need to break from this basic usage yet.

Once you are satisfied scroll to the bottom of the page and click the green "Generate Token" button. Your token will be displayed on the next page. **Once you navigate away from this page you will not be able to see you PAT again.** Copy the token and store it somewhere safe. I store mine as an entry in password manager.

## Set your PAT in R

Whenever you are prompted for your password you will need to enter your PAT. If you are using Windows/Mac you can store your PAT directly in R using the package `gitcreds`:

```{r}
#| eval: false
install.packages("gitcreds")

library(gitcreds)
gitcreds::gitcreds_set()
```
