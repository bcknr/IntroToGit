If you have questions or get stuck at any point create an issue by clicking ["Report an Issue"](https://github.com/bcknr/IntroToGit/issues/new) on the right of every page. Note: a GitHub account is required to submit an issue.

I encourage everyone to keep tabs on the [issues](https://github.com/bcknr/IntroToGit/issues) in the workshop's repo and answer each others questions! Feel free to use this as a place to work together as you continue to learn Git and GitHub.

## What are issues?

The issues tab is the place in a repo to keep track of bugs, to-dos, feature requests, questions, and more. For the sake of simplicity, there are two main uses for those of us who generally use GitHub for data analysis:

1)  Many R packages use GitHub for development, and creating an issue is a great way to communicate directly with the package developers. If you are looking for help with a popular R package (think `tidyverse`) you are probably better off using resources like Stack Overflow. However, the issue tab can be a great resource for niche or uncommon packages. Just make sure to check that your question wasn't already answered!

### Tip - Minimal Reproducible Examples

Whenever you ask a question or report a bug, create a Minimal Reproducible Example (MRE). There are many resources for learning about the best practices for MREs, such as [this Stack Overflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/5963610).

2)  When collaborating with others using GitHub, the issues tab is a great place to communicate and keep organized. You can create to-dos or highlight bugs/errors in the analysis, assign collaborators to certain tasks, and label each issue with custom tags.

### Creating an Issue

To create an issue, navigate to the package or projects repo, click `Issues` -\> `New issue`

Issues support markdown styling, code chunks, and mentions. On the right, you will see options to add labels and to assign the issue to someone.
