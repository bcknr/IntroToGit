Lastly, we will check that our set-up worked by creating a new git repository. I won't go into the details of what we are doing here-- we will cover that during the workshop-- but for now, trust the process.

## Create a Repo

1.  Log in to your [GitHub](https://github.com/) account and click ![green new repo button](/images/new.png){width="69"} on the left hand side of the home page.

2.  Name your repo, provide a brief description, check "Add a README file," and then click![](/images/createrepo.png){width="120"}

    ![](/images/newrepo.png)

3.  Click ![](/images/code.png){width="86"} and copy the "HTTPS" link

    ![](/images/clone.png){width="400"}

## Clone your Repo

1.  Open RStudio and create a new project: `File` -\> `New Projectâ€¦` -\> `Version Control` -\> `Git`

## Error: RStudio can't find Git

2.  Paste the link you copied from GitHub in the *Repository URL* field. The *Project directory name* fill will be automatically populated with the name of your Repo on GitHub. Select a location to store your project. Take note of where you are saving your project. I store all of my version controlled (Git) projects in a subdirectory of my home directory named "github" (`~/github`). This has the benefit of keeping everything in one easy-to-find location. After you click create project, you may be prompted to enter your GitHub credentials.

### Entering Credentials

Remember: whenever you are prompted to enter your GitHub password enter your **PAT**.

## Check connection

You should now see a new *Git* tab in the "environment panel" in RStudio and a couple of new files in your project folder. To make sure everything is set up correctly and you can communicate with GitHub, we will "commit" our first change.

1.  Navigate to the project you just created in RStudio, open the `README.md` file, make a minor edit, and save your changes.

2.  You should now see `README.md` in the Git tab

    ![](/images/readme_git.png)

3.  Check the *Staged* box next to `REARME.md`. Click ![](/images/pull.png){width="58"} and then ![](/images/commit.png)

4.  In the window that popped up, type "update readme" in the *commit* box and hit commit

    ![](/images/commitwindow.png)

5.  A status window will open. If there are no errors, hit the close button and then ![](/images/push.png)

6.  Open the repo on GitHub and check that your edits were made by looking at the README.md file.
