This introductory workshop will cover the fundamentals of using Git and GitHub in the R studio environment. We will introduce what Git and GitHub are, how Github can improve reproducibility, and how Git can benefit your existing research and data analysis process in R.

In this short workshop, we will get you started on your Git journey, starting with the processes of installing and connecting Git and GitHub. You will learn a basic workflow for incorporating Git into your research. Learn about linking a GitHub 'repo' to R studio, the "pull - commit - push" process, collaborating with others, and how Git can help you recover from programming disasters.

### Pre-workshop Homework

Installing and configuring Git and GitHub be finicky. Please attempt to work through the [getting started](/installation.qmd) page *prior* to attending the workshop.

This workshop pulls heavily from Jenny Bryan's resource ["Happy Git and GitHub for the useR"](https://happygitwithr.com/index.html). As you continue learning to use Git, keep this resource close by.
